Project Name: 0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
Authors: Orlando Gama and X Chauke

0. Fork me if you can!
mandatory
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

“Who did this code?”
“How it works?”
“Where are unittests?”
“Where is this?”
“Why did they do that like this?”
“I don’t understand anything.”
“… I will refactor everything…”
But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

For this project you will fork this codebase:

update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v2
update the README.md with your information but don’t delete the initial authors
If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named AirBnB_clone_v2 with the same content of AirBnB_clone

1. Bug free!
mandatory
Do you remember the unittest module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.
2. Console improvements
mandatory
Update the def do_create(self, arg): function of your command interpreter (console.py) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

Command syntax: create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...
Param syntax: <key name>=<value>
Value syntax:
String: "<value>" => starts with a double quote
any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash \
all underscores _ must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string My little house to the attribute name, your command line must be name="My_little_house"
Float: <unit>.<decimal> => contains a dot .
Integer: <number> => default case
If any parameter doesn’t fit with these requirements or can’t be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped
3. MySQL setup development
mandatory
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_dev_db
A new user hbnb_dev (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_dev should be set to hbnb_dev_pwd
hbnb_dev should have all privileges on the database hbnb_dev_db (and only this database)
hbnb_dev should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_dev_db or the user hbnb_dev already exists, your script should not fail
4. MySQL setup test
mandatory
Write a script that prepares a MySQL server for the project:

A database hbnb_test_db
A new user hbnb_test (in localhost)
The password of hbnb_test should be set to hbnb_test_pwd
hbnb_test should have all privileges on the database hbnb_test_db (and only this database)
hbnb_test should have SELECT privilege on the database performance_schema (and only this database)
If the database hbnb_test_db or the user hbnb_test already exists, your script should not fail
5. Delete object
mandatory
Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)

Add a new public instance method: def delete(self, obj=None): to delete obj from __objects if it’s inside - if obj is equal to None, the method should not do anything
Update the prototype of def all(self) to def all(self, cls=None) - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with State - it’s an optional filtering
6. DBStorage - States and Cities
mandatory
SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It’s time to change your storage engine and use SQLAlchemy
7. DBStorage - User
mandatory
Update User: (models/user.py)

User inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class User:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, users
class attribute email
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute password
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute first_name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can be null
class attribute last_name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can be null
8. DBStorage - Place
mandatory
Update Place: (models/place.py)

Place inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Place:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, places
class attribute city_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to cities.id

9. DBStorage - Review
mandatory
Update Review: (models/review.py)

Review inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Review:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, reviews
class attribute text
represents a column containing a string (1024 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute place_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to places.id
class attribute user_id
represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
can’t be null
is a foreign key to users.id
10. DBStorage - Amenity... and BOOM!
mandatory
Update Amenity: (models/amenity.py)

Amenity inherits from BaseModel and Base (respect the order)
Add or replace in the class Amenity:
class attribute __tablename__
represents the table name, amenities
class attribute name
represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
can’t be null
class attribute place_amenities must represent a relationship Many-To-Many between the class Place and Amenity. Please see below more detail: place_amenity in the Place update
Update Place: (models/place.py)

Add an instance of SQLAlchemy Table called place_amenity for creating the relationship Many-To-Many between Place and Amenity:
table name place_amenity
metadata = Base.metadata
2 columns:
place_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of places.id, primary key in the table and never null
amenity_id, a string of 60 characters foreign key of amenities.id, primary key in the table and never null
Update Place class:
for DBStorage: class attribute amenities must represent a relationship with the class Amenity but also as secondary to place_amenity with option viewonly=False (place_amenity has been define previously)
for FileStorage:
Getter attribute amenities that returns the list of Amenity instances based on the attribute amenity_ids that contains all Amenity.id linked to the Place
Setter attribute amenities that handles append method for adding an Amenity.id to the attribute amenity_ids. This method should accept only Amenity object, otherwise, do nothing.
